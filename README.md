# Messages Sender for Google Messages
This uses the pyautogui library to control your computers periferals so that it can send messages.

# Usage
Either use the executable file or the python file. If using the python file, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the directory where the repository is cloned. This will install pyautogui.
On the first line of text.txt enter the name (same as in your google contacts) or phone number of the recipient.
In the rest of the file place any text you want to send, for example, the Shrek script or a song.
The program will split the file at each '.' and remove any '\n'. Each sentence will then be sent one at a time.
